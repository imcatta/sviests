Shout-out to [Bradley Jennings](https://github.com/bradjenn/cards-against-humanity) for original source code. I have added responsiveness and attempted to fix a bug that crashes the server when players join or leave a game in progress. 


### To-do

Still learning to code, so my additions to the code are a bit spaghetti. Sometimes games are left in an unplayable state and most of node packages are out of date. Pull requests welcome! 

### Setup

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install

Check package.json for other scripts.
